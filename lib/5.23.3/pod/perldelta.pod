=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.23.3

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.23.2 release and the 5.23.3
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.23.1, first read
L<perl5232delta>, which describes differences between 5.23.1 and 5.23.2.

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 C<qr/(?[ ])/> now works in UTF-8 locales

L<Extended Bracketed Character Classes|perlrecharclass/Extended Bracketed Character Classes>
now will successfully compile when S<C<use locale>> is in effect.  The compiled
pattern will use standard Unicode rules.  If the runtime locale is not a
UTF-8 one, a warning is raised and standard Unicode rules are used
anyway.  No tainting is done since the outcome does not actually depend
on the locale.

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 An off by one issue in C<$Carp::MaxArgNums> has been fixed

C<$Carp::MaxArgNums> is supposed to be the number of arguments to display.
Prior to this version, it was instead showing C<$Carp::MaxArgNums> + 1 arguments,
contrary to the documentation.

A number of cleanups have been made to perlcall, including:

=item *

use EXTEND(SP, n) and PUSHs() instead of XPUSHs() where applicable
and update prose to match

=item *

add POPu, POPul and POPpbytex to the "complete list of POP macros"
and clarify the documentation for some of the existing entries, and
a note about side-effects

add API documentation for POPu and POPul

use ERRSV more efficiently

approaches to thread-safety storage of SVs.

=head1 Diagnostics

The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic output,
including warnings and fatal error messages.  For the complete list of
diagnostic messages, see L<perldiag>.

=head2 New Diagnostics

=head3 New Errors

=over 4

=item *

L<%s must not be a named sequence in transliteration operator|perldiag/"%s must not be a named sequence in transliteration operator">

(F) Transliteration (C<tr///> and C<y///>) transliterates individual
characters.  But a named sequence by definition is more than an
individual charater, and hence doing this operation on it doesn't make
sense.

=head1 Testing

=item *

Parallel building has been added to the dmake C<makefile.mk> makefile. All
Win32 compilers are supported.

=head1 Platform Support

=head2 Platform-Specific Notes

=over 4

=item EBCDIC C<cmp()> and C<sort()> fixed for UTF-EBCDIC strings

Comparing two strings that were both encoded in UTF-8 (or more
precisely, UTF-EBCDIC) did not work properly until now.  Since C<sort()>
uses C<cmp()>, this fixes that as well.

=item EBCDIC C<tr///> and C<yr///> fixed for C<\N{}>, and C<S<use utf8>> ranges

Perl v5.22 introduced the concept of portable ranges to regular
expression patterns.  A portable range matches the same set of
characters no matter what platform is being run on.  This concept is now
extended to C<tr///>.  See
C<L<trE<sol>E<sol>E<sol>|perlop/trE<sol>SEARCHLISTE<sol>REPLACEMENTLISTE<sol>cdsr>>.

There were also some problems with these operations under S<C<use
utf8>>, which are now fixed

=item Win32

=over

=item *

Parallel building has been added to the dmake C<makefile.mk> makefile. All
Win32 compilers are supported.

=item AmigaOS

The AmigaOS port has been reintegrated into the main tree, based off of
Perl 5.22.1.

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

C<qr/(?[ () ])/> no longer segfaults, giving a syntax error message instead.
[perl #125805]

=item *

Regular expression possessive quantifier v5.20 regression now fixed.
C<qr/>I<PAT>C<{>I<min>,I<max>C<}+>C</> is supposed to behave identically
to C<qr/(?E<gt>>I<PAT>C<{>I<min>,I<max>C<})/>.  Since v5.20, this didn't
work if I<min> and I<max> were equal.  [perl #125825]

=item *

C<< BEGIN <> >> no longer segfaults and properly produces an error
message.  [perl #125341]

=item *

In C<tr///> an illegal backwards range like C<tr/\x{101}-\x{100}//> was
not always detected, giving incorrect results.  This is now fixed.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated
from version control history. In particular, it does not include the names of
the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
tracker.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.
